  featured_publication:
    title: "Featured Research"
    paper_title: "Neurologic Outcomes in People with Multiple Sclerosis Treated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors"
    authors: "Quinn CM, Rajarajan P, Gill AJ, Kopinsky H, Wolf AB, Soares de Camargo C, Lamb J, Bacon TE, Murray JC, Probasco JC, Galetta KM, Kantor D, Coyle P, Bhise V, Alvarez E, Conway SE, Bhattacharyya S, Kister I"
    description: "This comprehensive study represents the first systematic analysis of neurological safety outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for concurrent malignancies. Through a retrospective multicenter cohort study involving 31 MS patients treated with ICIs, we investigated the complex interactions between cancer immunotherapy and pre-existing autoimmune neuroinflammation. The study utilized standardized neurological assessments, MRI imaging protocols, and immunological biomarker analysis to evaluate both MS disease activity and treatment-related neurological adverse events. Key findings demonstrate that while ICI therapy can potentially exacerbate MS symptoms in a subset of patients, careful monitoring and interdisciplinary management approaches can mitigate these risks. The research provides evidence-based guidance for oncologists and neurologists managing this challenging patient population, establishing monitoring protocols and risk stratification strategies that balance cancer treatment efficacy with neurological safety."
